# Prompts for the First Classifier tutorial.

I work in python and  I want to make a classification demo for a ML course.
I need a piece of code that generates some tabular data.
The last column is the target. The problem is a separable, binary problem.
The first column is a mixture of two gaussians, with some overlapping, One gaussian for each class.
 The second column helps discriminate in the cases where the first column is overlapping.
 One class is centered around origin and the other class is distributed above and below the values of the first class.
 The third column is random uniform noise.

Given a pandas dataframe give me a function that plots in the same graph, one histogram per each class

Write a function, that, given such a dataframe, will emit a numpy array with labels 0 and 1, randomly distributed
for each row in the dataframe.

Using scikit learn library please add code that evaluates how well the randomly predicted labels are matching the
 actual labels from the dataframe. Report accuracy.

write a piece of code that will classify all instances as zero, if the first column is less than 0
